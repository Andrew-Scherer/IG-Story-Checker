# Story Checker Investigation and Fix Plan

## Phase 1: Critical Issues (COMPLETED)

### 1. Impossibly Quick Success Issue
Fixed in Batch Log of batch processes.

- [x] Implement detailed timing logs in batch_processor.py
  - [x] Add start and end time logging for story check process
  - [x] Log duration of story check in BatchLogService
- [x] Implement detailed timing logs in StoryChecker
  - [x] Add start and end time logging for each HTTP request
  - [x] Log overall duration of check_story method
  - [x] Log duration of _get_profile and _get_stories methods
- [x] Add request/response logging (with sensitive info redacted)
  - [x] Log request headers and body
  - [x] Log response headers and body summary
- [x] Implement thorough validation of story presence
  - [x] Check for specific fields in the stories response that indicate an active story
  - [x] Validate the structure and content of story items
- [x] Fixed validation of story data structure
  - [x] Handle case where user has no stories properly
  - [x] Validate response structure without requiring story presence

### 2. Error Handling and Classification (COMPLETED)
- [x] Enhance exception handling in StoryChecker
  - [x] Added detailed error logging with type and message
  - [x] Modified check_story to handle specific error cases
  - [x] Ensured original exception information is preserved in logs
- [x] Updated Worker class to handle and log specific error types
  - [x] Added is_valid() check for sessions
  - [x] Improved rate limit handling
  - [x] Better error classification and logging
- [x] Implemented more granular error reporting
  - [x] Added detailed error logging in batch_processor.py
  - [x] Enhanced BatchLogService with detailed error information

### 3. Asynchronous Execution Flow (COMPLETED)
- [x] Review and update asynchronous calls in batch_processor.py
  - [x] Ensured all async calls are properly awaited
  - [x] Implemented proper error handling for async operations
- [x] Added logging for start and end of async operations
- [x] Fixed worker pool initialization to be on-demand

## Phase 2: High Priority Improvements (COMPLETED)

### 1. Session Management
- [x] Improved session management
  - [x] Added is_valid() method to Session model
  - [x] Implemented session validation before use
  - [x] Added session status tracking
- [x] Enhanced session cleanup
  - [x] Proper cleanup in StoryChecker
  - [x] Resource management in worker pool
- [x] Added session health checks
  - [x] Validation before story checks
  - [x] Status tracking in database

### 2. Proxy Handling (COMPLETED)
- [x] Enhanced proxy management
  - [x] Added rate_limited and last_used columns
  - [x] Improved state tracking
  - [x] Better error handling
- [x] Implemented proxy rotation strategy
  - [x] Added least-recently-used selection
  - [x] Improved state synchronization
  - [x] Added usage tracking

### 3. Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement adaptive rate limiting
  - [ ] Create a RateLimiter class using token bucket algorithm
  - [ ] Integrate RateLimiter into StoryChecker and Worker classes
- [ ] Add backoff strategy for rate limit errors
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff on receiving 429 status codes

## Phase 3: Optimization and Monitoring

### 1. Caching
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for user IDs
  - [ ] Create a UserIDCache class
  - [ ] Modify _get_profile method to use cache for user IDs
- [ ] Add cache for recent story check results (with short TTL)
  - [ ] Create a StoryCheckCache class
  - [ ] Update check_story to use cache for recent checks


## Phase 4: Documentation and Maintenance

### 1. Code Documentation
- [ ] Update inline code documentation
  - [ ] Ensure all classes and methods have clear docstrings
  - [ ] Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create architectural documentation
  - [ ] Document system components and their interactions
  - [ ] Create flowcharts for key processes (e.g., story checking workflow)

### 2. Operational Documentation
- [ ] Write runbooks for common operational tasks
  - [ ] Document procedures for restarting services, clearing caches, etc.
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Develop maintenance schedules and procedures
  - [ ] Define regular maintenance tasks (e.g., log rotation, database cleanup)
  - [ ] Create checklists for system health checks
